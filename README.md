# Kubernetes Deployment

This demonstration is intended to show off the CI/CD possibilities of Kubernetes; specifically Review Apps. Review Apps are 'per branch' deployments which are then accessible via their own URL. They are useful as they allow a developer to show their work at any stage to anyone who might be interested.
